# Airbyte 1.6 Release

## Overview

Airbyte 1.6 was released on April 15, 2025.

## Create custom connectors from YAML or Docker images

Airbyte now offers a Public API for managing connector definitions, enabling you to programmatically create, update, and manage custom connectors:

- **Source and Destination Connectors**: Create custom connectors from Docker images with full CRUD operations through our API endpoints
- **Low-Code Connectors**: Build and deploy connectors using YAML manifests without writing code
- **Workspace-Specific Management**: All connector definitions are scoped to workspaces for better organization and access control

### API Endpoints

The new endpoints follow this pattern:
```
/workspace/{workspaceId}/definitions/sources
/workspace/{workspaceId}/definitions/destinations
/workspace/{workspaceId}/definitions/declarative-sources
```

Each endpoint supports standard operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for listing, creating, updating, and removing connector definitions.

### Use Cases

- **Integration Developers**: Programmatically deploy and manage custom connectors
- **Solution Providers**: Create specialized connectors for specific data sources
- **Enterprise Users**: Maintain private connectors for internal systems
- **Low-Code Builders**: Deploy connectors built with the Connector Builder through API automation

This feature empowers users to extend Airbyte's connector ecosystem with their own custom connectors, all manageable through a consistent API interface.
