# Use Airbyte Embedded

Now that your app is running, you can create users as required. Once you create the user, you will be presented with the Embedded widget to create connection endpoints.

Within Airbyte, the user and connections will be assigned to a new workspace of the same name as the user you created. Within this workspace, the admin, will be able see connections created by the end user
