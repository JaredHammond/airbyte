# Deploy Airbyte to AWS EKS

Airbyte is built to be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster. This tutorial walks you through deploying Airbyte Self-Managed Community, Airbyte's open source product, on [AWS EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/). It is intended for Software/DevOps Engineers who already use, or want to begin using, AWS for infrastructure. It is accessible to beginners, but assumes you have functional knowledge of:

- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/)
- [AWS products and infrastructure](https://aws.amazon.com/products/)
- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- [eksctl](https://eksctl.io/)

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a production-ready version of Airbyte running on an EKS cluster.

:::note
If you aren't a Kubernetes expert or don't actually need to run on EKS, [deploying to EC2](deploy-airbyte-aws-ec2) is usually simpler.
:::

## Before you start

### Requirements

Before starting this tutorial, install the following tools on your local machine and add them to your PATH.

- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- [eksctl](https://eksctl.io/installation/#docker)

### Suggested resources {#suggested-resources}

For best performance, run Airbyte on a machine with 4 or more CPUs and at least 8GB of memory. We also support running Airbyte with 2 CPUs and 8GM of memory in low-resource mode. Follow this [Github discussion](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/discussions/44391) to upvote and track progress toward supporting lower resource environments.

<!--
It's easiest if they're all running in the [same virtual private cloud](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/network-reqs.html).

- An [AWS EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) cluster running on EC2 instances with [2 or more availability zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/disaster-recovery-resiliency.html) and a minimum of 6 nodes
- An [Application Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html)
- A URL to access the Airbyte UI and make API requests
- An [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket with two directories: one for log storage and another for state storage
- Optional, but recommended: An [Amazon RDS Postgres](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/) database
- [Amazon Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) 

-->

### Limitations

Things to keep in mind.

- It's easiest if all your customizations run in the [same virtual private cloud](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/network-reqs.html).

## What involved in an EKS deployment

- Consider integrations beforehand and set up that infra.
- Authenticate and connect to AWS
- Add the Airbyte Helm repository
- Create a namespace
- Configure your customizations
- Deploy

## Part 1: Set up your infrastructure

## Part 2: Authenticate and connect to AWS

Before you can deploy Airbyte, authenticate with AWS and connect to your EKS cluster.

1. Authenticate with AWS. The wizard is easiest, but there are [other options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-authentication-user.html).

    ```bash
    aws configure
    ```

    You must supply your AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key. You can also supply a default region name and default output format, if you have a preference.

2. Connect `kubctl` to your EKS cluster. [Learn more about connecting to EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-kubeconfig.html).

    1. Create or update a `kubeconfig` file for your cluster. Replace `us-west-1` with the AWS Region that your cluster is in and replace `airbyte` with the name of your cluster, if yours are different.

        ```bash
        aws eks update-kubeconfig --region us-west-1 --name airbyte
        ```

        You should see something like this:

        ```bash
        Added new context arn:aws:eks:us-west-1:432613289033:cluster/airbyte to /Users/art.vandelay/.kube/config
        ```

    2. Test your configuration.

        ```bash
        kubectl get svc
        ```
        
        You should see something like this:

        ```bash
        NAME             TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
        svc/kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.100.0.1   <none>        443/TCP   1m
        ```

        If you see errors, troubleshoot with [Unauthorized or access denied (kubectl)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/troubleshooting.html#unauthorized).

## Part 3: Add the Airbyte Helm repository

The Airbyte deployment process uses a Helm chart, which is a package for Kubernetes applications. It's like a blueprint or template that defines the resources needed to deploy an application on a Kubernetes cluster. Charts are stored in `helm-repo`.

1. Add the Helm charts. In this example, `airbyte` represents the name of the repository you'll index locally.

    ```bash
    helm repo add airbyte https://airbytehq.github.io/helm-charts
    ```

2. Index the repo.

    ```bash
    helm repo update
    ```

3. If you want to browse all the Helm charts added to your local repo, run:

    ```bash
    helm search repo airbyte
    ```

    The output should look something like this:

    ```bash
    NAME                               	CHART VERSION	APP VERSION	DESCRIPTION

    airbyte/keycloak                   	1.3.0        	1.3.0      	Helm chart to deploy airbyte-keycloak             
    airbyte/keycloak-setup             	1.3.0        	1.3.0      	Helm chart to deploy airbyte-keycloak-setup

    airbyte/temporal                   	1.3.0        	1.3.0      	Helm chart to deploy airbyte-temporal             
    airbyte/temporal-ui                	1.3.0        	1.3.0      	Helm chart to deploy airbyte-temporal-ui          
    airbyte/webapp                     	1.3.0        	1.3.0      	Helm chart to deploy airbyte-webapp               
    airbyte/worker                     	1.3.0        	1.3.0      	Helm chart to deploy airbyte-worker               
    airbyte/workload-api               	0.50.3       	0.50.35    	Helm chart to deploy the workload-api service     
    airbyte/workload-api-server        	1.3.0        	1.3.0      	Helm chart to deploy the workload-api service     
    airbyte/workload-launcher          	1.3.0        	1.3.0      	Helm chart to deploy airbyte-workload-launcher 
    ```

## Part 4: Create a namespace for Airbyte

It's not strictly necessary to isolate the Airbyte installation into its own namespace, but we recommend it as a best practice. This example assumes you chose the name `airbyte` for the namespace, but you can choose a different name.

To create a namespace run the following command.

```bash
kubectl create namespace airbyte
```

You should see something like this:

```bash
namespace/airbyte created
```

## Part 5: Configure your customizations

Airbyte has everything you need to use the product. In some cases, Airbyte's defaults are enough, but they do have limitations and aren't for everyone.

<!-- Bryce has a good example here of a "complete" secrets and values file: https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/discussions/47256#discussioncomment-11082158 -->

### Configure Kubernetes secrets

### Create a values.yaml file to customize your deployment

### Configure a database

### Configure external logging

### Configure audit logging (Self-Managed Enterprise only)

### Configure external connector secret management

### Configure ingress

### Configure authentication

### Configure a custom image registry

### Configure your service account

## Part 6: Deploy Airbyte {#deploy-airbyte}

Once you have applied your secret values to your Kubernetes cluster and completed your `values.yaml` file with your customizations, you're ready to deploy Airbyte.

  1. Install Airbyte.

      ```bash
      helm install \
      airbyte \
      airbyte/airbyte \
      --namespace airbyte \
      --values ./values.yaml
      ```

      If you are not using any customizations or secrets (rare), use this command, instead:

      ```bash
      helm install \
      airbyte \
      airbyte/airbyte \
      --namespace airbyte  
      ```

  2. Set up port forwarding so you can access your Airbyte UI.

      ```bash
      export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace airbyte -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=webapp" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
      export CONTAINER_PORT=$(kubectl get pod --namespace airbyte $POD_NAME -o jsonpath="{.spec.containers[0].ports[0].containerPort}")
      echo "Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080 to use your application"
      kubectl --namespace airbyte port-forward $POD_NAME 8080:$CONTAINER_PORT
      ```

You can now access Airbyte in your browser at: http://127.0.0.1:8080 or, if you set up a URL earlier, you can use that URL.

## What's next

Congratulations! You now have a fully-functional production deployment of Airbyte.

- **Move data**: In Airbyte, you move data from [sources](../using-airbyte/getting-started/add-a-source) to [destinations](../using-airbyte/getting-started/add-a-destination.md). The relationship between a source and a destination is called a [connection](../using-airbyte/getting-started/set-up-a-connection.md). Try moving some data.
- **Change customizations**: If something about your cloud infrastructure changes later on, make the corresponding update in your `values.yaml` file, then rerun [`helm install`](#deploy-airbyte). <!-- Need to verify this, I'm actually not sure if you need to rerun -->
- **Update Airbyte**: We release new versions of Airbyte and its connectors regularly. [Keep Airbyte up to date](../operator-guides/upgrading-airbyte.md) to get the latest features and fixes.
