# Organizations

The highest level of structure in Airbyte is an **organizations**. Organizations are how you manage access to Airbyte, billing, and overall account usage. Most Airbyte users belong to a single organization, but some Airbyte users consult for multiple clients and move from one organization to another.

Self-Managed deployments only have one organization, but you can deploy Airbyte multiple times to establish different organizations.
